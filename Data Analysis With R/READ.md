This tidy data set contains 4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

With the help of R language, I analyse with variable affects the quality of wine, and how large the affect is.
